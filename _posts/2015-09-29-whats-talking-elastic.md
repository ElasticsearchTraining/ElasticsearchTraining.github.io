title: What's Talking Elastic?
---

Welcome to [Talking Elastic](/). 

The motivation for creating Talking Elastic is to:

* express my thoughts and use cases on Elasticsearch
* encourage like minded indivduals and/or organizations to air views and ideas on Elasticsearch
* act as a supplement to [Elasticsearch Training](https://github.com/elasticsearchtraining)
* explore technologies and integrations around Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is an open source and popular software to search and 
analyze data. Over the years, it's parent company [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) has added other products to it's portfolio.

I have been working on Elasticsearch for the past couple of years. Like a lot of people, I am impressed with it's
architecture and capabilities.

If you are interested, please feel free to contribute plugins, tutorials, code samples, gists to [Elasticsearch Training](https://github.com/elasticsearchtraining) or articles on [Talking Elastic](/).

Let's keep talking!

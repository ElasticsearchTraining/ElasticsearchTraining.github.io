title: What's Talking Elastic?
---

Welcome to [Talking Elastic](/). 

As you may be aware [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a popular and open source software to search 
and analyze data. It is built on top of another popular open source software, [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/). Over the years, 
the parent company [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) has added other products to it's portfolio.

The objective of Talking Elastic is to discuss tutorials, features and training on Elasticsearch. As Elasticsearch itself is currently 
open source, Talking Elastic also follows in the same vein. Even though the focus is on Elasticsearch, it will provide a ample 
opportunities to explore other technologies and use cases around it.

Find out more by visiting the [Elasticsearch Training](https://github.com/elasticsearchtraining) project. If you are interested, 
please feel free to contribute to [Elasticsearch Training](https://github.com/elasticsearchtraining) or [Talking Elastic](/).

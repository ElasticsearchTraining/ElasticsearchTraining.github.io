Before diving into Elasticsearch, let's step back on the modern history of search. In academic terms, it falls under the broader field of Information Retrieval. 

As we started digitizing data in the 1950's, the need for search arose. It all probably started with programs like Augmented Human Intellect, created by Douglas Engelbart. Incidentally, he is more popularly known as the inventor of the mouse. You can read more about the history and overview of search [here](https://github.com/ElasticsearchTraining/TrainingMaterial/blob/master/Basics/Elasticsearch%20Training%20%E2%80%93%20Session%201.pdf).

Coming to Elasticsearch, the best place to get started with Elasticsearch is to head to their [site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html). 
I would recommend to get started with their excellent [Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html).

Some of the key features of Elasticsearch are:

* It has a distributed architecture. You can start from 1 and scale out to N nodes. This naturally provides high availability.
* Based on the use case, there are multiple options for multi-tenancy.
* Provides a multi-lingual full text search.
* Data stored is document oriented and schema-free.
* REST API's and various programming language SDK's are available.
* Built on top of Lucene. If you have already used other search software like Solr, you may be familiar with Lucene's capabilities.

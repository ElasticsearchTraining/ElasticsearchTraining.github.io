Before diving into Elasticsearch, let's step back on the modern history of search. In academic terms, it falls under the broader 
field of Information Retrieval. You can read more about it in my overview [here](https://github.com/ElasticsearchTraining/TrainingMaterial/blob/master/Basics/Elasticsearch%20Training%20%E2%80%93%20Session%201.pdf).

The best place to get started with Elasticsearch is of course to head to their [site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html). 
I would recommend to get started with the [Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html).

Some of the key features of Elasticsearch are:

* It has a distributed architecture. You can start from 1 and scale out to N nodes. This naturally provides high availability.
* Based on the use case, there are multiple options for multi-tenancy.
* Provides a multi-lingual full text search.
* Data stored is document oriented and schema-free.
* REST API's and various programming language SDK's are available.
* Built on top of Lucene.

The objective of [Talking Elastic](/) is to:

* express my thoughts and use cases on Elasticsearch
* encourage like minded indivduals and/or organizations to air views and ideas on Elasticsearch
* act as a supplement to [Elasticsearch Training](https://github.com/elasticsearchtraining)
* explore technologies and integrations around Elasticsearch

In keeping with the simple theme, this blog does not and will not:

* track users who visit this site
* embed any advertisements

This blog is built using the Jekyll [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme (credit to [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo)).
